## Overview
The Earthquake Data Visualization Project aims to create an interactive and informative tool for visualizing earthquake data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). This project addresses the need for meaningful representation of vast amounts of seismic data collected globally, enhancing public awareness and aiding government organizations in understanding natural hazards.

## Background
The USGS is dedicated to providing scientific data on natural hazards, ecosystem health, and the impacts of climate and land-use changes. Their scientists develop innovative methods to deliver timely and relevant information about the Earths processes. However, the current challenge lies in effectively visualizing the extensive earthquake data they collect daily.

## Objectives
- **Develop an Interactive Map**: Create a user-friendly map that displays earthquake occurrences, magnitudes, and depths using dynamic markers.
- **Enhance Public Education**: Provide a tool that helps educate the public and government agencies about seismic activity and its implications.
- **Support Funding Initiatives**: Equip the USGS with a compelling visualization tool that can aid in securing funding for further research and development.

## Features
- **Dynamic Circle Markers**: Each earthquake is represented by a circle marker whose size corresponds to its magnitude and whose color indicates its depth.
- **Interactive Popups**: Users can click on markers to view additional information about each earthquake, including its title, magnitude, and depth.
- **Legend for Interpretation**: A comprehensive legend that explains the color coding for depths and the size scaling for magnitudes.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web application.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and data manipulation.
- **Leaflet.js**: A powerful library for interactive maps.
- **D3.js**: For data fetching and manipulation.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/smwhite24/leaflet-challenge.git
Open index.html in a web browser.
Ensure an internet connection to fetch earthquake data from the USGS GeoJSON feed.

### Future Enhancements
Incorporate additional datasets, such as historical earthquake data.
Implement filtering options for users to view specific timeframes or magnitudes.
Enhance the user interface for better accessibility and user experience.


## Conclusion
This project serves as a vital step in transforming raw earthquake data into a visually engaging and educational tool. By effectively communicating seismic activity, we aim to foster greater public understanding and support for ongoing research in natural hazards.
